									<h1>About Andrea</h1>
									
									
								</header>
								
								<p>Hi, I'm Andrea, and I'm passionate about leveraging <strong>data</strong> to drive impactful decisions. I hold a <strong>Master's degree</strong> in International Business from the Universit√† degli Studi di Verona, where my final dissertation focused on the <strong>integration of ASEAN</strong>, providing me with a deep understanding of <strong>international trade dynamics</strong>.</p>

                                <p>My educational journey also took me abroad to <strong>Romania</strong> as an <strong>Erasmus</strong> student, and I have gained valuable work experience in <strong>Poland</strong> as an <strong>International Marketing Specialist</strong>. In this role, I worked on <strong>social media campaigns</strong> targeting specific audiences, conducting research, and creating posts. This experience not only fueled my passion for <strong>diverse cultures</strong> but also honed my ability to tailor messages to different <strong>target audiences</strong>.</p>

                                <p>To complement my academic background, I have earned several certifications, including an <strong>IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate</strong>. This program equipped me with theoretical and practical knowledge in <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Power BI</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>. Additionally, I am proficient in <strong>Excel</strong> and <strong>MySQL Workbench</strong>, enabling me to clean, extract, and visualize <strong>data</strong> effectively.</p>

                                <p>Driven by a continuous desire to learn, I also completed the <strong>Google Digital Marketing & E-commerce Certificate</strong>, which provided me with foundational knowledge in <strong>Google Ads</strong>, <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, <strong>SEO</strong>, and <strong>email marketing strategies</strong>.</p>

                                <p>I am currently working as a <strong>Quality Assurance and Database Specialist</strong> at <strong>Dale Consulting</strong>, where I test <strong>software functions for banking systems</strong>, ensuring optimal <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>reliability</strong>. This role has sharpened my <strong>analytical skills</strong> and <strong>attention to detail</strong>, which are crucial in the field of <strong>data analysis</strong>. Additionally, I have experience as a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> at <strong>ACER</strong>, where I was responsible for managing and analyzing <strong>large datasets</strong> to support <strong>decision-making processes</strong>.</p>

                                <p>My professional journey is further enriched by the <strong>Zenrest project</strong>, a conceptual <strong>branding initiative</strong> that allowed me to demonstrate my <strong>graphic design</strong> and <strong>creative skills</strong>. Through this project, I developed a comprehensive <strong>brand identity</strong>, including <strong>logo creation</strong>, <strong>color palette design</strong>, <strong>typography selection</strong>, and <strong>marketing material production</strong>. The experience showcased my ability to merge <strong>aesthetic principles</strong> with <strong>strategic thinking</strong> to create cohesive and impactful <strong>visual storytelling</strong>.</p>
